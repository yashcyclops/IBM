Restaurant sentiment analysis
The requirement was to predict the Restaurant review with training and testing accuracy to be nearly equal.
First model:Using GuassianNB. The data loading and preprocessing steps are done and GuassianNB algorithm is used.Using this algorithm the accuracy was 74%.
Second model:Using Random forest classifier. Using this algorithm the training accuracy is 79.62% and the testing accuracy is 78% and this satisfies the requirement that training and testing accuracy should be similar.
Using random forest classifier we can achieve greater accuracies.
Finally our model predicted the positive(output=1) review and negative(output=0) review correctly.
